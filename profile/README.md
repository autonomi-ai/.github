# Autonomi AI :rocket:

Welcome to [Autonomi AI](https://autonomi.ai)! We're the creators of [**nos**](https://github.com/autonomi-ai/nos), a fast inference server for modern AI workloads. With a few lines of code, developers can optimize, serve, and auto-scale Pytorch model inference without having to deal with the complexities of ML compilers, HW-accelerators, or distributed inference. Simply put, NOS allows AI teams to cut inference costs up to 10x, speeding up development time and time-to-market.
